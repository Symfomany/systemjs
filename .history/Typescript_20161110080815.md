# Configuration of TypeScript


By default, launch by tsconfig.json :

``` 
tsc
``` 

# Some options

+ files: all files included (alias of include)
+ By default all visible “@types” packages are included in your compilation.
+ If typesRoots is specified, only packages under typeRoots and no packages from ./node_modules/@types.
+ Compile on save :IDE to generate all files for a given tsconfig.json upon saving.

+ noImplicitAny:  it lets you know if any of your expressions or declarations have an implied "any" type
+ preserveConstEnums:  not to erase const enum declarations in your generated code
+ sourceMap:  tend to only use this in development while debugging
